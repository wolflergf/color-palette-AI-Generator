# Color Palette AI Generator

This repository contains a Color Palette AI Generator, which is a Flask application that uses OpenAI's text-based AI model to generate color palettes based on verbal descriptions, themes, moods, or instructions provided in the prompt.

## What the project does
The Color Palette AI Generator utilizes the power of AI to convert text prompts into visually appealing color palettes. By providing a description or set of keywords, the AI model generates a list of colors represented by hexadecimal color codes. The color palettes consist of 2 to 8 colors, and the generated results are provided in a JSON array format.

## Why the project is useful
The Color Palette AI Generator can be useful in various design-related scenarios, such as graphic design, web development, UI/UX design, branding, and more. It helps designers and creatives to quickly explore color options based on textual descriptions, allowing them to generate color palettes that align with their desired themes, moods, or instructions.
